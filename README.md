## Overview

Tado Hijack is engineered to maintain your smart home functionality regardless of strict API limits. It uses adaptive polling and command batching to stay within quota constraints.

It is designed to work **alongside** your local HomeKit (v3) or Matter (Tado X) integrations. Use local protocols for temperature control, and Tado Hijack for cloud-only features (Schedules, Hot Water, AC Pro, Hardware Settings, and Indoor Climate Sensors).

> [!NOTE]
> **High API Usage is Expected:**
> Auto Quota dynamically consumes the available quota to provide the fastest possible updates. If the daily limit is reduced by Tado, the system will automatically slow down to prevent account locks.

<br>

### Key Features:

- **Auto API Quota:** Dynamically adjusts polling intervals based on your remaining daily API calls and detects your account's specific reset time.
- **Command Batching:** Fuses multiple concurrent commands into a single API call.
- **Multi-Generation Support:** Full support for V2 (GW bridges), V3 Classic (HomeKit), and Tado X (Matter) within a unified architecture.
- **Device Unification:** Attaches cloud features (child lock, offset, battery, …) onto the existing HomeKit (v3) or Matter (Tado X) device when the cloud serial matches. Home Assistant 2026.8+ no longer merges two integrations into one registry device; the entities still show on the local device page.
- **Indoor Climate Sensors:** Calculates dew point, absolute humidity, and mold risk per zone.
- **Night-Savings (Economy Window):** Slows down polling during the night to save API calls for daytime use.

>
> - **Other integrations:** Support Tado X only via **full cloud** (no local control, 100% API dependent)
> - **Tado Hijack:** Uses **Matter** for local temperature control + cloud API for advanced features (Schedules, QuickActions, etc.)
>
> We support **BOTH** Tado v3 Classic (HomeKit) **AND** Tado X (Matter) through a unified architecture. Note: Some features are v3-specific (AC Pro, Early Start, Hot Water temp control) due to hardware limitations. Tado X supports Hot Water as auto/off (programmer/domesticHotWater).

<br>

## Key Highlights

<br>

### Extreme Batching Technology

<br>

While other integrations waste your precious API quota for every tiny interaction, Tado Hijack features **Deep Command Merging**. We collect multiple actions and fuse them into a single, highly efficient bulk request.

<br>

> [!TIP]
> **Maximum Fusion Scenario:**
> Triggering a "Party Scene": **AC living_room** (Temp + Fan + Swing) + **AC kitchen** (Temp + Fan) + **Hot Water** (ON).
>
> ❌ **Standard Integrations:** 6-8 API calls (Half your hourly quota gone).
> ✅ **Tado Hijack:** **1 single API call** for everything.
>
> _Note: This works within your configurable **Debounce Window**. Every action is automatically fused._

<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Universal Batching:** This applies to manual dashboard interactions AND automated service calls (like `set_mode`). 10 changes at once? **Still only 1 API call.**

<br>

---

<br>

### The Local "Missing Link"

<br>

**We don't replace local control. We enhance it.**

**For V3 (HomeKit):** Tado Hijack matches the cloud serial (`VA…`) to your HomeKit device and **attaches** cloud-only entities (child lock, offset, battery, connection) onto that HomeKit device. Local `climate` stays HomeKit; Hijack features appear on the same device page.

**For Tado X (Matter):** Same attach when Matter exposes the cloud serial (`serial_number` or `serial_VA…`). If Matter does not expose the serial, features stay on the Hijack device (manual temp-source linking still works).

Home Assistant 2026.8+ keeps **one registry device per integration**, so you may still see a Hijack TRV and a HomeKit/Matter TRV as “linked devices”. That is expected. **Do not delete the Hijack device** — if HomeKit/Matter is missing later, cloud features land on Hijack again automatically.

<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Hybrid Architecture:**
> This integration is designed to work **alongside** native local control:
>
> - **Tado v3 Classic:** Works with HomeKit Device integration (provides `climate` entity for local temperature control)
> - **Tado X:** Works with Matter integration (provides `climate` entity for local temperature control)
> - **Tado Hijack:** Provides the "Missing Links" for **both generations** (Schedules, Hot Water, AC Modes, Hardware Settings)
>   - **Device Unification:** Cloud entities attach to the HomeKit (v3) or Matter (Tado X) device when serial numbers match. Leave the Hijack device in place; it is the fallback when the local protocol is gone.
>
> _Note: **Full Cloud Mode** provides climate entities via API polling but consumes API quota for temperature changes. See [Full Cloud Mode](#full-cloud-mode-all-generations) for details._

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> **No Redundancy (Default Mode):** By default, Tado Hijack does **not** create climate entities, as local protocols (HomeKit/Matter) already handle temperature control efficiently. We focus on cloud-only features: **Schedules, Hot Water, AC Modes, Hardware Settings**.
>
> **Full Cloud Mode:** Optionally enables cloud-polling climate entities, **but consumes API quota** for every temperature change. Only recommended for V2 bridges (20k calls/day) or users without HomeKit/Matter access.

<br>

<br>

### Cloud Features (Non-HomeKit)

- **🚿 Professional Hot Water Platform:** Native `water_heater` entity. v3: `auto` / `heat` / `off` + target temperature. Tado X: `auto` / `off` via `programmer/domesticHotWater` (no temp control). Full Pre-Validation ensures you never send invalid configurations.
- **❄️ AC Pro Features:** Precise Fan Speed and Swing (Horizontal/Vertical) selection.
- **📅 Schedule Transparency:** View the target temperature of your active Smart Schedule directly via the `auto_target_temperature` attribute while in `auto` mode (available for Heating, AC and Hot Water).
- **🕵️‍♂️ Expert-Level Error Capturing:** Captures the actual response body from Tado\'s API (e.g. _"temperature must not be null"_), giving precise feedback for troubleshooting.
- **🔥 Valve Opening Insight:** View the percentage of how far your valves are open (updated during state polls).
- **🔋 Real Battery Status:** See the actual health of every valve.
- **🌡️ Temperature Offset:** Interactive calibration for your thermostats.
- **✨ Dazzle Mode:** Control the display behavior of your V3+ hardware.
- **🏠 Presence Lock:** Force `home` or `away` globally via the `presence_mode` select entity. Set to `auto` to hand control back to Tado's own geofencing. **Note:** Handing control back to Tado via `auto` requires a Tado **Auto-Assist** subscription. If you don't have Auto-Assist, use `home` or `away` to manually lock the presence state via your own HA automations.
- **🔥 Dynamic Presence-Aware Overlay:** Set temperatures specifically for the current presence state — automatically resets once your home presence changes.
- **🌡️ Indoor Climate Intelligence:** Per-zone sensors for **dew point**, **mold risk** (level + binary), **indoor absolute humidity**, and **ventilation recommendation**. Calculated from room temperature and humidity using the Magnus formula and EU building-physics thresholds. Available for both v3 Classic and Tado X.
- **🔓 Rate Limit Bypass:** Support for local [tado-api-proxy](https://github.com/s1adem4n/tado-api-proxy).

<br>

### State Integrity & Robustness

<br>

Tado Hijack implements enterprise-grade state management to ensure your settings never get lost or overwritten:

- **💾 State Memory:** AC fan speed, swing positions, and target temperatures survive Home Assistant restarts. No more "reset to default" frustration.
- **🔒 Field Locking:** Prevents concurrent API calls from overwriting each other. Change fan speed, then swing, then temperature in rapid succession — all settings are preserved.
- **🎯 Pending Command Tracking:** Rapidly clicking temperature buttons (+/-) or dragging a slider? Multiple UI events collapse into **1 API call** with the final value. Zero waste, zero duplicates.
- **⏮️ Rollback on Error:** If an API call fails (e.g., invalid payload), the UI automatically reverts to the previous state with a clear error message. No "ghost states" where the UI lies about what's active.
- **🧵 Thread-Safe Queue:** All write operations pass through a single serialized queue. Automations, dashboard changes, and service calls never conflict or race.

<br>

> [!TIP]
> **tado-api-proxy TL;DR:**
> The proxy acts as a local cache and authentication handler. It allows you to use your integration without being strictly bound to Tado's cloud limits.
>
> 1. Run the [Docker Container](https://github.com/s1adem4n/tado-api-proxy#docker-setup).
> 2. Set your `API Proxy URL` in Hijack Options (e.g., `http://192.168.1.10:8080`).
> 3. Enjoy unlimited local-like polling (safety floor still applies).

<br>

## API Consumption Strategy

<br>

Tado's API limits are restrictive. That's why Tado Hijack uses a **Zero-Waste Policy**.

<br>

### API Consumption Table

<br>

| Action              |  Cost  | Frequency     | Description                              | Detailed API Calls                                                                     |
| :------------------ | :----: | :------------ | :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Zone Poll**       | **1**  | Adaptive      | HVAC, Valve %, Humidity.                 | v3: `GET /homes/{id}/zoneStates`<br>X: `GET hops…/rooms` (+ DHW if installed)          |
| **Presence Poll**   | **1**  | 12h (Default) | Home/Away presence state.                | **Both gens:** `GET my.tado.com/api/v2/homes/{id}/state` (not Hops)                    |
| **Hardware Sync**   | **1–2+** | 24h (Default) | Syncs battery, firmware and device list. | v3: `GET /zones` + `GET /devices` (+ caps)<br>X: `GET hops…/roomsAndDevices` (**1**) |
| **Refresh Zones**   | **1–2**  | On Demand     | Updates zone/device metadata.            | v3: zones + devices<br>X: `roomsAndDevices`                                            |
| **Refresh Offsets** | **1–N**  | On Demand  | Fetches device offsets. 1 call with `entity_id`, N without. | v3: `GET /devices/{s}/temperatureOffset`<br>X: usually in metadata snapshot        |
| **Refresh Away**    | **1–M**  | On Demand  | Fetches zone away temps. 1 call with `entity_id`, M without. | v3 only (`awayConfiguration`). Tado X: not available via API                     |
| **Zone Overlay**    | **1**  | On Demand     | **Fused:** All zone changes in 1 call.   | v3: `POST /homes/{id}/overlay`<br>X: per-room `manualControl` (or quickActions)        |
| **Presence**        | **1**  | On Demand     | Force presence lock (home/away=PUT, auto=DELETE). | **Both gens:** `PUT/DELETE …/presenceLock` on my.tado.com (v2)                  |

_Notes:_
- **Presence is always the classic v2 API** for both v3 Classic and Tado X (`/state`, `/presenceLock`). Hops `roomsAndDevices` does **not** include home/away.
- Room/device control for Tado X uses the Hops API (`hops.tado.com`). See [Generation Support](#generation-support-v3-classic--tado-x).
- Default presence poll is 12h → **~2 calls/day**. Manual refresh / set still costs 1 call each.

<br>

> [!TIP]
> **API Optimization Features:**
>
> - **Zero Waste Writes:** Commands don't trigger a poll. We use Local State Patching to update the UI instantly without confirmation calls.
> - **Throttled Mode:** When quota runs low, periodic polling auto-disables to preserve quota for your automations.
> - **Granular Refresh:** Hardware configs (Offsets, Away Temps) are never fetched automatically — only on-demand when you need them.

<br>

### Auto API Quota & Economy Window

Tado Hijack features a self-optimizing quota management system that distributes your available API calls across the day.

#### Core Mechanics

- **Adaptive Polling:** Automatically calculates and adjusts the background polling interval based on your remaining daily API quota and the time left until the next reset.
- **Threshold Protection:** You can configure a "Throttle Threshold" (default: 20 calls). This quota is reserved exclusively for external automations, scripts, and manual app usage. Background polling will pause if this threshold is reached, ensuring manual actions still work.
- **Night-Savings (Economy Window):** Configure an Economy Window (e.g., 23:00 - 07:00) to slow down or pause polling during sleep hours. The system reinvests these saved calls into faster updates during your active hours.
- **Adaptive Reset Learning:** Tado's quota reset time varies by user. The integration learns your specific reset schedule by observing reset patterns and optimizes the budget distribution accordingly (planning at least 20 hours ahead).
- **Proxy Support:** Fully compatible with the local `tado-api-proxy`. The system will automatically optimize polling for the higher quota limits provided by the proxy.

#### Adaptive Behavior & Safety

Your polling interval scales dynamically:
- **Performance Phase:** While active, updates can arrive as fast as every 20s (or 120s if using a proxy).
- **Economy Phase:** During your sleep window, polling drops to a heartbeat or pauses completely.
- **Safety Floor:** To protect your account, minimum intervals are strictly enforced (Standard: 5s, Proxy: 120s).

<br>

<br>

### Batching Capability Matrix

<br>

Not all API calls are created equal. Tado Hijack optimizes everything, but physics (and the Tado API) sets limits.

<br>

| Action Type       | Examples                                                            | Strategy      | API Cost                                      |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------ | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **State Control** | Target Temp, Turn Off All, Resume Schedule, Hot Water Power, AC Fan | **FUSED**     | **1 Call Total** (regardless of zone count)   |
| **Global Mode**   | Home/Away Presence                                                  | **DIRECT**    | **1 Call**                                    |
| **Zone Config**   | Early Start, Open Window, Dazzle Mode                               | **DEBOUNCED** | **1 Call per Zone** (Sequentially executed)   |
| **Device Config** | Child Lock, Temperature Offset                                      | **DEBOUNCED** | **1 Call per Device** (Sequentially executed) |

<br>

> **Fused (True Batching):**
> Multiple actions across multiple zones are merged into a **single** API request.
> _Example: Turning off 10 rooms at once = **1 API Call**._
>
> **Debounced (Rapid Update Protection):**
> Prevents spamming the API during rapid interactions (like clicking buttons or dragging sliders). Only the final value is sent.
> _Example: Rapidly clicking a temperature button or dragging a slider from 18°C to 22°C generates multiple events, but only **1 API Call** is sent._

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> **Exceptions:** Device configs (Child Lock, Offset) require individual API calls per device. See [Services](#services) table for complete API impact breakdown.

<br>

## Architecture

<br>

### Physical Device Mapping & Resolution

<br>

Unlike other integrations that group everything by "Zone", Tado Hijack maps entities to their **physical devices** (Valves/Thermostats).

- **Matched via Serial Number:** Cloud entities attach to the existing HomeKit (v3) or Matter (Tado X) device when HA exposes the same serial as the cloud. HA 2026.8+ does not merge registry devices across integrations.
- **EntityResolver:** Deep-scans the Home Assistant registry to link local climate entities with Tado's cloud zones.
- **No local match?** Entities live on a dedicated Hijack device with **only** the cloud features (Battery, Offset, Child Lock, etc.), **no** temperature control. If HomeKit/Matter comes back, they attach there again. Leave leftover Hijack device pages — do not delete them.

<br>

### Robustness & Security

<br>

- **JIT Poll Planning:** Uses high-precision timestamps instead of simple flags to decide exactly when a data fetch is required (Zero-Waste).
- **Monkey-Patching Utilities:** We actively fix `tadoasync` library limitations at runtime, including robust deserialization for tricky cloud states (like `nextTimeBlock` null errors).
- **Custom Client Layer:** Extended underlying library via inheritance to handle API communication reliably and fix common deserialization errors.
- **Safety Throttle (Anti-Spam):** If the Tado API reports an invalid limit (e.g., `<= 0` during outages), the integration automatically throttles to a **5-minute safety interval** and logs a warning to prevent rapid re-polling.
- **Authenticated Proxy Support:** Fully supports path-based authentication for the API Proxy, ensuring your external communication remains secure and private.
- **Persistent Reconnect & Recovery:** When the API quota is exhausted (throttled), the system performs a recovery check every **15 minutes** (reduced from 1h) to ensure immediate resumption of services as soon as the API becomes available or the quota resets.
- **Privacy by Design:** All standard logs and diagnostic reports are automatically redacted. Sensitive data is stripped before any output is generated. (See [Expert-Level Diagnostics](#expert-level-diagnostics) for details).
- **🎭 Pattern Obfuscation:** Multi-Level Jitter (Poll & Call) breaks temporal correlation between Home Assistant triggers and API requests to avoid pattern-based throttling (Proxy only).

<br>

## Installation

<br>

> [!CAUTION]
> **Remove the Official Tado Integration:**
> You **MUST** remove the official Home Assistant Tado integration before installing Tado Hijack. Keeping both active will cause conflicting commands and double your API quota consumption, likely leading to account locks.

<br>

### Via HACS (Recommended)

<br>

Tado Hijack is now an **official HACS integration**! No custom repository needed.

1. Open **HACS** -> **Integrations**.
2. Search for **"Tado Hijack"** and click **Download**.
3. **Restart Home Assistant**.
4. Go to **Settings** -> **Devices & Services** -> **Add Integration** -> Search for **"Tado Hijack"**.
5. **Select your hardware generation** (determined by your physical Tado bridge):
   - **Tado v3 Classic** - If you own an **IB01** or **GW01** bridge (black square box)
   - **Tado X** - If you own a **Bridge X (IB02)** (newer Matter-based system)

<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Hardware Generation:**
> Select your generation during setup based on your physical bridge: IB01/GW01 = **v3 Classic**, IB02 = **Tado X**. If unsure, choose v3 Classic (most common). See [Generation Support](#generation-support-v3-classic--tado-x) for feature differences.

| :--------------------------------- | :-------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Status Polling**                 | `30m`     | Base interval for room states. **Note:** Dynamically overridden by _Auto API Quota_ when enabled; serves as fallback during throttling or budget exhaustion.                                                                                               |
| **Presence Polling**               | `12h`     | Interval for Home/Away state. High interval saves mass quota. (1 API call)                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Auto API Quota**                 | `80%`     | Target X% of FREE quota. **Note:** The official API is currently limited to **1,000 calls/day**. Using the **API Proxy** bypasses this limitation, granting **3,000 calls per account**. Uses a weighted profile to prioritize performance hours.          |
| **Reduced Polling Active**         | `Off`     | Enable the time-based weighted polling profile.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Reduced Polling Start**          | `22:00`   | Start time for the economy window (e.g. when you sleep).                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Reduced Polling End**            | `07:00`   | End time for the economy window.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Reduced Polling Interval**       | `3600s`   | Polling interval during the economy window. Set to **0** to pause polling entirely.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Hardware Sync**                  | `86400s`  | Interval for battery, firmware and device metadata. Set to 0 for initial load only.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Offset Update**                  | `0` (Off) | Interval for temperature offsets. Costs 1 API call per valve.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Min Polling Window**             | `20s`     | **Performance Floor:** The absolute fastest speed Auto Quota will poll (5s-12h, default: 20s).                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Debounce Time**                  | `5s`      | **Batching Window:** Fuses actions into single calls.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Refresh After Resume**           | `On`      | Auto-refresh target temperature/state after resume schedule (HVAC AUTO). Required because schedules are Tado cloud-side. Uses 1s grace period to merge multiple resumes. Costs 1 API call.                                                                 |
| **Throttle Threshold**             | `20`      | **External Protection Buffer:** Reserve N calls for everything outside of Hijack's periodic background polling (External Automations, Scripts, Manual App use). Polling stops when remaining quota hits this floor to ensure your automations never stall. |
| **Quota Safety Reserve**           | `2`       | **Reset Window Bridge:** API calls reserved from quota percentage for the ±1h window around the expected reset time. Distributed evenly during the window to bridge uncertainty when reset time varies (e.g., 11:05 vs 11:30 UTC). Set to 0 to disable (not recommended). |
| **Disable Polling When Throttled** | `Off`     | Stop periodic polling entirely when throttled.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **API Proxy URL**                  | `None`    | **Advanced:** URL of local `tado-api-proxy` workaround.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **API Proxy Token**                | `None`    | **Security:** Authentication token for your proxy. Injected into the path (`/token/api/v2`).                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Call Jitter**                    | `Off`     | **Anti-Ban Protection:** Adds random delays before API calls to obfuscate automation patterns (Proxy only).                                                                                                                                                |
| **Jitter Strength**                | `10%`     | The percentage of random variation applied to intervals and delays (Proxy only).                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Log Level**                      | `INFO`    | Control integration verbosity (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR).                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Show Version in Logs**           | `On`      | Prepends `[vX.Y.Z]` to every log message from this integration. Makes the running version immediately visible in any log snippet — useful when sharing logs for support.                                                                                   |
| **Suppress Redundant Calls**      | `Off`     | **API Optimization:** Skip API calls when target state matches cached state (temperature, mode, presence, power). Saves quota on accidental double-clicks or UI interactions. Only sends when actual change detected. Values not in cache always send. |
| **Suppress Redundant Buttons**     | `Off`     | **Aggressive Optimization:** Also skip button actions (resume_all, boost_all, turn_off_all, set_mode_all) when ALL zones already match target state. Requires 'Suppress Redundant Calls' to be enabled. Individual explicit actions always send. |
| **Dew Point Sensor**               | `On`      | Create a dew point temperature sensor per zone (Magnus formula, T + RH). v3: falls back to cloud zone state. Tado X: requires a linked temperature source on the zone device. |
| **Mold Risk Sensors**              | `On`      | Create a mold risk level sensor (`none`/`low`/`medium`/`high`) and a binary moisture sensor per zone. Uses dew point spread — correctly distinguishes cold-but-dry from cold-and-humid rooms. |
| **Extended Data Fetch**            | `On`      | Fetch extended zone data (e.g. additional capabilities) during polling. Disable to reduce API payload size. |
| **Outdoor Weather Entity**         | `None`    | Select a weather entity providing outdoor temperature + humidity. When set, creates an indoor absolute humidity sensor (g/m³) and a ventilation recommendation binary sensor per zone. |
| **Ventilation Threshold**          | `1.0 g/m³`| Minimum indoor-outdoor AH difference required before _Ventilation Recommended_ turns ON. Prevents automation chatter from negligible differences. |
| **Temperature Source** _(per zone)_| `Automatic`  | Optional: link a temperature `sensor` or `climate` entity as the data source for indoor climate sensors. Set via `select.zone_temp_source` on each zone device. Required for Tado X (cloud has no temp in Full-Matter mode). |
| **Humidity Source** _(per zone)_   | `Automatic`  | Optional: link a `climate` entity (reads `current_humidity`) or a humidity `sensor` as the data source for indoor climate sensors. Set via `select.zone_humidity_source` on each zone device. Fallback: cloud zone state humidity. |

<br>

### Zone Temperature & Humidity Sources (All Generations)

<br>

Each zone device exposes two optional source selectors that override the data used for indoor climate calculations (dew point, mold risk, absolute humidity, ventilation recommendation):

| Select Entity              | Purpose                               | Accepted types               |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :--------------------------- |
| `select.zone_temp_source`  | Temperature override for the zone     | Any `climate` or temperature `sensor` |
| `select.zone_humidity_source` | Humidity override for the zone     | Any `climate` (reads `current_humidity`) or humidity `sensor` |

**Fallback chain when no source is selected:**

| Priority | Temperature fallback | Humidity fallback |
| :------- | :------------------- | :---------------- |
| **1. Select Entity** | Entity chosen in `select.zone_temp_source` | Entity chosen in `select.zone_humidity_source` |
| **2. Connected Climate** | Associated Climate Entity (Full-Cloud or mapped HomeKit) | Tado Hijack Humidity Sensor (`sensor.X_humidity`) |
| **3. Cloud API** | `sensor_data_points.inside_temperature` (All Gens) | `sensor_data_points.humidity` (All Gens) |

> [!TIP]
> **For Tado X:** Prefer a linked Matter `climate` (automatic when serial numbers match, or via `select.zone_temp_source`). That gives real-time local temps for indoor climate sensors instead of slower cloud polling.

> [!NOTE]
> For **v3 Classic**, linking sources is **optional**. The built-in HomeKit linkage and zone state provides both temperature and humidity automatically. Link an external sensor only if you want higher precision or a different measurement point.

Changes take effect on the next coordinator update — no integration reload required.

<br>

### Full Cloud Mode (All Generations)

<br>

> [!WARNING]
> **Full Cloud Mode: When to Use It**
>
> Full Cloud Mode creates climate entities via cloud polling instead of HomeKit/Matter integration.
>
> **✅ RECOMMENDED FOR:**
> - **V2 Bridges (GW)** - These lack HomeKit/Matter support, making Full Cloud Mode the **only** option for climate entities
> - V2 bridges have **~20,000 calls/day** which makes cloud polling viable
>
> **⚠️ USE WITH CAUTION:**
> - **V3 Bridges (IB01/GW01)** - Currently 1k calls/day, reducing to 100 soon
> - **Tado X (IB02)** - Currently 1k calls/day, reducing to 100 soon
> - **Recommendation:** Use HomeKit (V3) or Matter (X) integration instead — no API cost, local control
> - Full Cloud Mode is **technically supported** for all generations but **not recommended** for V3/X due to quota limits
>
> **⚠️ API QUOTA IMPACT:**
> - Every temperature change = 1 API call
> - **V2:** ~20k calls/day makes cloud polling sustainable
> - **V3/X:** 1k calls/day (soon: 100) exhausted quickly by temperature changes
> - **Best Practice:** Use HomeKit/Matter for V3/X to preserve quota for advanced features
>
> **Configuration:**
> - Enable during setup: Config Flow → **Full Cloud Mode** toggle

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> **Schedule Planning Sensors:**

<br>

> [!TIP]
> **Intelligent Post-Action Polling (`refresh_after`):**
> When active, the integration uses a smart decision engine to save API quota:
>
> - **Immediate Refresh:** Triggered for `auto` (Resume Schedule) or permanent manual changes. Since the target state is reached immediately, an instant GET request confirms the cloud synchronization.
> - **Intelligently Deferred:** For timed modes (`duration`), the refresh is **deferred** until the timer actually expires. Polling immediately during a timer is wasteful; we wait for the "expiry event" to fetch the new post-timer state.
> - **Event-Aware:** For `next_block` or `presence` overlays, immediate polling is suppressed as the cloud state transition depends on external time/events.

<br>

> [!TIP]
> **Targeting Rooms:** You can use **any** Tado zone entity (climate, switch, sensor) or even **device entities** (battery, connection, child_lock) as the `entity_id`. Device entities automatically resolve to their zone via serial number lookup. This includes your existing **HomeKit climate** entities (e.g. `climate.living_room`).
>
> **Targeted Fetch:** When using `manual_poll` with an `entity_id`, the refresh is limited to that single entity — `offsets` costs 1 API call instead of N, `away` costs 1 instead of M. `capabilities` uses the lazy cache and only drops that zone's entry. Bulk types (`zone`, `metadata`, `presence`, `all`) always fall back to a full refresh.

<br>

> [!TIP]
> **Multi-Home Service Routing:**
> Have multiple Tado Homes configured? Our service routing is fully multi-account aware!
>
> - **Global Execution (Default):** Call `tado_hijack.resume_all_schedules` with empty data `{}` -> The command is sent to **all** configured Tado homes automatically.
> - **Targeted Execution:** Use the new `config_entry` parameter in your service call (available in the UI) to select a specific home. -> The command is routed **exclusively** to the selected home.
> - **Batched Entity Routing:** When sending multiple `entity_ids` to `set_mode` that belong to different homes, Tado Hijack automatically sorts the entities and batches the API requests to their respective homes in parallel.

<br>

### `set_mode` Examples (YAML)

<br>

**Hot Water Boost (30 Min):**

```

<br>

**Manual Override (Indefinite):**

## Known Constraints

<br>

### API Limitations (Tado Backend)

<br>

While Tado Hijack optimizes every possible interaction, some operations are inherently limited by Tado's server-side architecture:

- **No Bulk Device Config:** Tado does **not** provide bulk API endpoints for hardware-specific settings. Temperature Offsets, Child Lock, and Window Detection must be sent individually (1 API call per device). If you change these for 10 devices, it will always cost 10 calls.
- **Schedule Logic is Cloud-Side:** When you "Resume Schedule", the actual target temperature is determined by Tado's servers. To show the correct value in HA immediately, a single confirmatory poll is required (if `Refresh After Resume` is enabled).
- **Sequential Execution:** To prevent account locks and respect the backend, device configuration commands are executed sequentially with a small delay.

<br>

### Hybrid Cloud Dependency

<br>

While Tado Hijack uses the cloud for its power-features, your basic smart home remains resilient:

- **Local Resilience:** Temperature control and heating state via **HomeKit** remain fully functional even during internet outages or Tado server issues.
- **Cloud-Only Features:** Access to Smart Schedules, Hot Water control, and AC-Pro features requires a connection to Tado's servers.
- **Why Cloud?** Tado does not expose a local API for advanced logic. Tado Hijack bridges this gap while keeping your local core intact.

## Troubleshooting

<br>

If you encounter issues, please check the following steps before opening a GitHub issue or asking on Discord.

<br>

### Expert-Level Diagnostics

<br>

Sharing diagnostics **should be safe**. Our built-in Diagnostic Report uses **Multi-Layer Anonymization** to protect your privacy while providing all necessary technical data. However, you should always verify the content yourself before posting it publicly. If in doubt, send the report via DM to an administrator.

- **🔑 Key Pseudonymization:** Home Assistant Entity-IDs in JSON keys are transformed into unique anonymized hashes (e.g. `sensor.entity_8a3f`). This protects your room names while maintaining machine-readability for debugging.
- **🛡️ PII Masking:** All sensitive names (Zones, Homes, Mobile Devices, Titles) are replaced with `"Anonymized Name"`.
- **🕵️‍♂️ Serial Number Protection:** Every hardware identifier (VA, RU, IB, etc.), E-mail address, and cryptographic secret (Tokens, Hashes) is automatically masked via intelligent Regex everywhere in the document.
- **📊 Pure Debug Power:** Despite maximum privacy, the report contains all technical insights needed for support:
  - Detailed Quota & Adaptive Interval math.
  - API Queue & Action status.
  - Internal Entity Mappings (Anonymized but uniquely identifiable).
  - Device Metadata (Firmware, Battery, Connection status).

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<br>

### Where are my climate entities and current temperature?

In the **default mode**, Tado Hijack does **not** create `climate` entities for heating zones — HomeKit (v3) or Matter (Tado X) already handle local temperature control efficiently at zero API cost.

**Full Cloud Mode** (enabled during setup) creates cloud-polled climate entities. This is required for V2 bridges (GW) that have no HomeKit/Matter support, and optional for V3/X.

**Why prefer local protocols over cloud API?**

| Reason | Explanation |
| :----- | :---------- |
| **API Quota** | Accurate temp polling needs 720-1,440 calls/day → quota exhausted. Current limit is 1,000 calls/day. |
| **Speed** | HomeKit/Matter = instant response. Cloud API = latency + polling delays. |
| **Reliability** | Local protocols work offline. Cloud API requires internet. |
| **Cost** | HomeKit/Matter = zero API calls. Cloud API = every action costs quota. |

**What each integration provides:**

| Integration | Temperature Control | Cloud Features | API Calls |
| :---------- | :-----------------: | :------------: | :-------: |
| **HomeKit/Matter** | ✅ (`climate` entities, current temp) | ❌ | 0 |
| **Tado Hijack** | ❌ | ✅ (Schedules, Hot Water, AC Pro, Hardware) | Optimized |

**Setup:** Install HomeKit/Matter first → then Tado Hijack. Cloud features attach to the local device when serial numbers match (HomeKit via `serial_number`; Matter when the same `VA…` is on `serial_number` or a `serial_VA…` identifier). You may still see a separate Hijack device page — leave it. If HomeKit/Matter is not found, features stay on Hijack.

<br>

### Why do I still see a Hijack TRV and a HomeKit/Matter TRV?

Home Assistant 2026.8+ no longer merges devices from two integrations into one registry entry. Hijack **attaches** child lock / offset / battery onto the HomeKit or Matter device when the serial matches, but the Hijack device page can remain.

**Do not delete the Hijack device.** If HomeKit or Matter is missing later (bridge offline, integration removed), those cloud entities are created on the Hijack device again. Deleting the leftover page only creates churn.

Zone-level entities (schedules, indoor climate, source selectors) always stay on Hijack zone devices.

<br>

### Why are my Tado X dew point / mold risk sensors unavailable?

For Tado X (without Full Cloud Mode), the cloud API often does not deliver a useful room temperature for climate math (TRV reports it locally via Matter).

- **If Matter exposes the device serial** (same `VA…` as the cloud): Hijack can link to the Matter device and may resolve the climate entity automatically for indoor climate sensors.
- **If not linked yet:** use the **Temperature Source** selector (`select.zone_temp_source`) on the zone device and pick the Matter `climate` entity or a temperature sensor. Once set, dew point, mold risk, and absolute humidity activate for that zone.

See [Zone Temperature & Humidity Sources](#zone-temperature--humidity-sources-all-generations) for details.
