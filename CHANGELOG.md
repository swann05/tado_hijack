* fix(tadox): skip water_heater when domesticHotWater state is NONE

Hops can return a programmer/domesticHotWater/state payload with state=NONE
(e.g. Heat Pump Optimizer X setups) which is not controllable via the
classic resumeSchedule/boost endpoints. Creating a water_heater entity in
that case led to 404s and a permanently stuck off state.

- TadoXHotWaterState.is_controllable rejects empty/NONE states
- Mapper does not inject zone 9001 unless controllable
- water_heater setup requires a controllable state

## [5.7.1](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v5.7.0...v5.7.1) (2026-07-24)
* fix(core): Tado X full-cloud climate guards, presence via v2, and Python 3.14

Guards Full Cloud climate entities on Tado X, fixes Home/Away reading for
Tado X, and aligns the toolchain with Home Assistant's Python 3.14 runtime.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🌡️ FULL CLOUD / TADO X CLIMATE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- TadoAirConditioning on GEN_X: hvac_modes limited to OFF/HEAT/AUTO
- fan_modes and swing_modes return None for GEN_X (no capabilities endpoint)
- _get_active_hvac_mode returns HEAT for GEN_X (all X rooms are heating)
- supported_features limited to temperature + on/off for GEN_X
- Prevents setup crashes and incorrect "cooling" action on heating zones

## [5.7.0](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v5.6.0...v5.7.0) (2026-06-30)
* feat(tadox): add Tado X hot water support (auto/off only via Hops) with central guards

Adds support for the domesticHotWater programmer on Tado X devices using the Hops endpoints (resumeSchedule + boost for forced off).

The changes also address AIR_CONDITIONING overlays where some V3 AC units declare a "light" capability per operating mode. Sending overlays without this field resulted in 422 "setting.notSupported" errors from the Tado API when changing fan speed, swing or mode. The light field is now populated from capabilities (when present) in TadoV3ActionProvider, following the same approach used for fan and swing fields. The FAN mode path in the climate entity is updated accordingly.

Fixes #105.

- Hot water exposed as virtual zone with reserved high ID (9001) instead of magic 0 to avoid truthiness and collision issues
- TadoHotWaterX entity limited to auto/off (no temperature control)
- Safe fetching with 404 caching to prevent repeated API calls on devices without hot water hardware installed
- Dedicated coordinator paths with optimistic updates for the Tado X specific operations
- All set hot water operations (auto, off, heat) correctly detect and route for TadoX real (9001) and test dummy (9997)
- Central redundancy_checker for hot water (v3 + TadoX through same guards)
- Central overlay_validator for TadoX hot water Hops calls
- _is_tadox_hot_water_zone helper for consistent detection

Hops programmer paths are fundamentally different from v3 overlays, so all operations must use the dedicated endpoints and go through the central guard infrastructure.

### ✨ New Features

* feat(translations): add Czech (cs) translation

## [5.5.0](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v5.4.0...v5.5.0) (2026-05-15)

### ✨ New Features

* feat: zone/home mode sensors, AC overlay 422 fixes, quota reliability, and Tado X control

Adds per-zone and home-level operating mode sensors, resolves AC overlay
422 rejections for standby zones, fixes three separate quota reliability
issues, corrects Tado X device mapping and timer overlays, and prevents
a startup crash when HA stores device.manufacturer as int.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📊 ZONE MODE & HOME MODE SENSORS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- sensor.zone_mode per zone: reports schedule / manual / boost / off
  for both Classic and Tado X; Classic boost detection uses the 25°C
  heuristic consistent with action_provider.py
- sensor.home_mode at home level: aggregates all zone modes; returns
  "mixed" when zones differ — useful for automations reacting to
  partial manual overrides
- No additional API calls; reads from already-fetched zone_states

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
❄️ AC OVERLAY 422 FIXES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Resolves HTTP 422 rejections when overriding AC zones in standby (schedule
"Off", fan_mode: null, no active overlay). Three separate gaps fixed:

- _ensure_ac_setting_fields coordinator helper: auto-populates fanSpeed/Level,
  swing, and light from cached capabilities when not provided by the caller;
  called from async_set_zone_overlay and per-zone from
  async_set_multiple_zone_overlays
- services.py _execute_set_mode: map operation_mode to ac_mode and forward to
  async_set_multiple_zone_overlays; the mode field was never included for the
  service path
- Single-toggle swing fallback: current state → last-seen cache → "OFF"
  (tadoasync does not expose single-toggle swing in mode capabilities)
- light field: included when mode capabilities expose it, defaulting to OFF

Refactored into _build_ac_fan_fields / _build_ac_swing_fields /
_build_ac_light_fields for clarity.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📈 QUOTA RELIABILITY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Three separate issues fixed:

DST drift (reset_window_tracker.py):
- Reset history stored in Europe/Berlin local time; after CET→CEST the
  learned reset hour shifted 1h in UTC, triggering conservation mode ~30
  min early; normalize all history to UTC
- _default_utc_window helper provides DST-aware UTC fallback across tracker
  and quota_math; config entry v10 migration converts existing history to UTC

Overconsumption:
- get_next_reset_time() anchored on now.replace() instead of last observed
  reset + 1 day, collapsing the adaptive interval to its 20s floor after
  every reset observation
- get_initial_target() cached a stale past timestamp; Tado X rate limit
  counter stayed frozen because Hops API calls bypassed the V3 handler;
  TadoXApi now captures rate limit headers directly

Runaway loop:
- schedule_reset_poll used max(1s, delay) as floor; stale initial_target
  produced a tight poll loop burning quota; replaced with an explicit 24h
  fallback; reset poll rescheduled immediately on detected reset to stay
  in sync without waiting for the next scheduled fire

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔧 TADO X FIXES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- _resolve_device_to_zone() used zone.id which doesn't exist on
  HopsRoomSnapshot; iterate zones_meta.items() and use the dict key as
  zone_id instead
- TadoXExecutor ignored the termination dict from merged overlay data;
  extract termination_type and duration_seconds and pass to
  async_set_manual_control so TIMER overlays via set_mode duration
  actually expire as intended

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🐛 REDUNDANCY FILTER FIXES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- _filter_presence and _filter_simple_attributes compared against the
  optimistic already-patched state, silently dropping every command when
  suppress_redundant_calls was enabled
- Debounce replacements overwrote the rollback reference with the intermediate
  optimistic state; preserve_rollback_state() now carries the original confirmed
  API state forward through replacements
- RESUME_SCHEDULE for zones already in schedule now filtered when
  suppress_redundant_buttons is enabled

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔍 DIAGNOSTICS & DEVICE LINKER
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- Serial redaction suffix increased from 4 to 5 chars to prevent false
  duplicate-device appearance when two serials share the same last 4 digits
- _is_tado_device() helper in device_linker.py guards isinstance before
  .lower(); HA device registry can store manufacturer as int, causing
  AttributeError on startup

## [5.5.0-dev.5](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v5.5.0-dev.4...v5.5.0-dev.5) (2026-05-15)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* fix(device-linker): guard against non-string manufacturer in device registry

- add _is_tado_device() helper that checks isinstance before .lower(),
  centralising the Tado manufacturer check (DRY)
- use _is_tado_device() in _build_device_cache() and get_climate_entity_id()
  replacing the bare device.manufacturer.lower() calls that raised
  AttributeError when HA stores manufacturer as int
- fix .gitignore to match dev/local as symlinks (trailing slash only
  matches real directories)

## [5.5.0-dev.4](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v5.5.0-dev.3...v5.5.0-dev.4) (2026-05-13)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* fix(ac): add light field to AC power-on overlay payloads

- extract _build_ac_fan_fields, _build_ac_swing_fields and
  _build_ac_light_fields from _ensure_ac_setting_fields to
  reduce function complexity and satisfy Sourcery quality check

- _build_ac_light_fields: include light field when the mode
  capability exposes it; defaults to "OFF" if present in the
  allowed values, otherwise first listed value

Resolves 422 errors for AC zones whose capabilities require a
light field in the overlay setting (e.g. "light not in supported
light [OFF, ON]").

## [5.5.0-dev.3](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v5.5.0-dev.2...v5.5.0-dev.3) (2026-04-30)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* fix(ac): populate mode, fanSpeed and swing for AC power-on overlays

- add _ensure_ac_setting_fields coordinator helper: fetches cached
  capabilities and auto-populates fanSpeed/Level and swing fields
  when additional_setting_fields is not explicitly provided; called
  from async_set_zone_overlay and per-zone from async_set_multiple_zone_overlays

- fix _execute_set_mode in services.py: map operation_mode to ac_mode
  (HEAT/COOL/DRY/FAN) and forward to async_set_multiple_zone_overlays;
  mode field was never set for this service path

- single-toggle swing fallback: use current state, last-seen cache,
  then "OFF" (tadoasync does not expose swings in mode capabilities)

Resolves 422 errors for AC zones in standby that were missing mode,
fanSpeed and swing fields in overlay payloads.

## [5.5.0-dev.2](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v5.5.0-dev.1...v5.5.0-dev.2) (2026-04-21)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* fix(quota): prevent reset-poll runaway loop and sync timer on detected reset

Replace max(1s, delay) in schedule_reset_poll with an explicit 24h fallback
when delay is invalid, preventing a tight API-quota-burning loop on stale
initial_target. Reschedule the reset poll immediately when a quota reset is
detected via regular polling so the timer stays in sync without waiting for
the next scheduled fire. Also refactor zone overlay/resume redundancy checks
into dedicated helpers for clarity.

## [5.5.0-dev.1](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v5.4.1-dev.2...v5.5.0-dev.1) (2026-04-17)

### ✨ New Features

* feat(sensors): add zone_mode and home_mode sensors (#86)

Adds per-zone operating mode sensor (schedule/off/boost/manual) for
both Tado Classic and Tado X generations, and a home-level aggregate
sensor that returns "mixed" when zones are in different modes.

No additional API calls - reads from already-fetched zone_states.
Boost detection for Classic uses the existing 25°C temperature heuristic
consistent with action_provider.py.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* fix(diagnostics): increase serial number redaction suffix to 5 chars

Prevents false duplicate-device appearance in diagnostics output when
two serials both end in the same 4 digits (e.g. both ending in "1234").

* fix(tadox): resolve device-to-zone mapping and pass termination to manual control (#89)

Fix _resolve_device_to_zone() using zone.id which doesn't exist on
HopsRoomSnapshot (Tado X zones use room_id). Iterate zones_meta.items()
and use the dict key as zone_id instead.

Fix TadoXExecutor ignoring the termination dict from the merged overlay
data. Extract termination_type and duration_seconds and pass them to
async_set_manual_control so TIMER overlays created via set_mode duration
parameter actually expire as intended.

## [5.4.1-dev.2](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v5.4.1-dev.1...v5.4.1-dev.2) (2026-04-14)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* fix: fix quota overconsumption, redundancy filter regression, and DE translations

Quota (fix):
- get_next_reset_time() anchored on now.replace(hour, minute) instead of
  last_history_entry + 1 day, collapsing adaptive interval to 20s minimum
  after every observed reset
- get_initial_target() cached a stale past timestamp and never refreshed,
  driving seconds_until_reset negative for all generations
- TadoX rate limit counter stayed frozen because hops.tado.com calls never
  went through the V3 handler; TadoXApi now captures ratelimit headers and
  exposes them via rate_limit_data. UnifiedDataProvider gains
  get_rate_limit_source() so the coordinator stays generation-agnostic

Redundancy (fix):
- _filter_presence and _filter_simple_attributes compared against the
  optimistic already-patched state, silently dropping every command when
  suppress_redundant_calls was enabled
- Debounce replacements overwrote the rollback reference with the optimistic
  intermediate state; preserve_rollback_state() now carries the original
  confirmed API state forward through replacements
- RESUME_SCHEDULE commands for zones already in schedule are now filtered
  when suppress_redundant_buttons is enabled

Redundancy (refactor):
- Extract _merge_keyed() in CommandMerger replacing 5 identical merge methods
- Replace 6x _filter_simple_attributes() calls with a config loop
- Add _suppress_calls/_suppress_buttons properties on TadoApiManager

i18n: fix raw key names shown as labels in Auto API Quota config section

## [5.4.1-dev.1](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v5.4.0...v5.4.1-dev.1) (2026-04-11)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* fix(quota): fix DST-driven reset prediction drift and CET->UTC migration

Root cause: quota reset history was stored in Europe/Berlin local time.
After CET->CEST, the learned reset hour shifted by 1h in UTC (e.g.
12:30 Berlin stored as 13:30 CEST = 11:30 UTC instead of 12:30 UTC),
causing the integration to enter quota-conservation mode ~30 min early.

reset_window_tracker.py:
- record_reset: normalize history in UTC instead of Berlin tz
- _update_learned_window: compute recent list once; detect pattern break
  (two newest entries disagree on UTC hour) and reset to 1 entry so the
  tracker re-learns cleanly; remove redundant same_hour_resets filter
- _default_utc_window: new helper to convert Berlin-local defaults to
  UTC respecting the current DST offset - single source of truth
- get_expected_window: use _default_utc_window so "default" confidence
  also returns correct UTC values, not Berlin-local hour as UTC
- get_next_reset_time: use _learned_window directly (learned and
  single_observation) so the proactive poll is never scheduled from the
  Berlin-local default hour treated as UTC; fall back to _default_utc_window
- ResetWindow.__str__: convert UTC hour to Berlin local for display
- to_dict: add data_version=2, drop serialized learned_window
- load_dict: remove inline migration (handled by config entry v10);
  fix duplicate initial_target parse; always re-derive learned_window
- DATA_VERSION = 2 class constant for versioned storage migration

quota_math.py:
- is_in_reset_safe_window: compare UTC hours instead of Berlin hours;
  when no explicit hour given, derive expected UTC hour from the
  Berlin-local default respecting the current DST offset

coordinator.py:
- async_setup: reschedule reset poll after loading stored tracker so
  the proactive poll fires at the correct learned time after a restart
  (previously scheduled in __init__ with an empty tracker)

migration.py / __init__.py / config_flow.py:
- _v10 (async): one-time migration of stored reset_tracker history from
  Berlin tz to UTC for existing users
- async_migrate_entry: await coroutine migration steps
- config entry VERSION bumped 9 -> 10

## [5.4.0](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v5.3.0...v5.4.0) (2026-04-07)

### ✨ New Features

* feat(core): presence mode select, redundancy checker fix, version logging, and climate fixes

Replaces the binary away_mode switch with a three-option presence_mode
select entity, fixes false-positive redundancy drops that silently
blocked hot water and zone overlays, adds toggleable version prefixing
in logs, and restores auto_target_temperature for heating zones.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🏠 PRESENCE MODE SELECT ENTITY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Replaces binary away_mode switch with select.tado_{home}_presence_mode:
- HOME: PUT presenceLock with homePresence=HOME
- AWAY: PUT presenceLock with homePresence=AWAY
- AUTO: DELETE presenceLock (restores Tado geofencing)

AUTO was previously inaccessible from HA, requiring manual API interaction
to restore automatic presence detection after a manual override.

Update automations targeting the old switch to use select.select_option:

  target:
    entity_id: select.tado_{home}_presence_mode
  data:
    option: home   # or: away / auto

Migration:
- Extracted all migration steps from __init__.py into helpers/migration.py;
  async_migrate_entry replaced with a simple loop over MIGRATION_STEPS.
- Migration v8 removes the legacy away_mode switch from the entity registry.
- Migration v9 re-runs the removal for installs where dev.1 already set
  VERSION=8, causing v8 to never execute.
- Config flow VERSION bumped to 9.
- Entity ID fix: was using bridge serial instead of home slug.

Note: restoring AUTO presence requires a Tado Auto-Assist subscription.
A persistent notification with the home name is shown if the API returns
HTTP 422 (Auto-Assist not available).

## [5.3.0](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v5.2.0...v5.3.0) (2026-04-03)

### ✨ New Features

* feat(tadox): sensor fixes, full diagnostics, and comprehensive documentation overhaul

This commit consolidates multiple critical fixes and feature expansions across the integration:

1. **Tado X Sensors & Fallbacks:**
   - Fixed missing temperature fallback by allowing Tado X to read
     `sensor_data_points.inside_temperature.value` from the cloud state via duck-typing.
   - Fixed heating power sensor displaying an `unknown` state by correctly reading

## [5.2.0](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v5.1.0...v5.2.0) (2026-04-01)

### ✨ New Features

* feat(core): comprehensive indoor climate intelligence, meter reading service, and bug fixes

Introduces indoor climate intelligence with dynamic source selection,
a meter reading service for Tado Energy IQ, and a series of targeted
bug fixes across quota management, services, Tado X capability inference,
entity ID generation, and tooling alignment.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🌟 INDOOR CLIMATE INTELLIGENCE & SENSORS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Advanced Climate Metrics:
- Added sensors for dew point, absolute humidity, and acute mold risk levels across all hardware generations.
- Implemented outdoor absolute humidity diagnostic sensor (g/m3).
- Centralized atmospheric physics into a shared module.

Dynamic Source Selection:
- Implemented per-zone Select entities to choose custom Temperature & Humidity sources.
- Robust 3-layer fallback system: User Select -> Climate Entity -> Cloud API.

Universal Support:
- Unified zone property access across Classic (v3) and Tado X via TadoUnifiedZone interface.
- Standardized climate entity capabilities.
- Updated binary sensor states to user-friendly Yes/No labels.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🛠️ METER READINGS & SERVICES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Energy IQ Integration:
- Implemented `tado_hijack.add_meter_reading` service to upload meter readings to the Tado cloud (v3 Classic only).
- Patched upstream `tadoasync` meter readings endpoint to fix 403 Forbidden errors.
- Fixed timezone handling to use local HA time instead of UTC for correct day assignments.

Multi-Account Services:
- Fixed service registry bug where services from multiple config entries would
  overwrite each other, causing actions to only work for the last registered account.
- Updated services.yaml with corrected field definitions.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🐛 BUG FIXES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Quota Management:
- Fixed progress_remaining exceeding 1.0 on fresh installs (initial target pushed to next day).
- Fixed budget collapse at day boundary where all consumed calls were misattributed
  as external usage, collapsing the polling budget before the actual quota reset.
- Introduced static initial_target to prevent runaway next reset target drift.
- Fixed calculate_remaining_polling_budget to derive polls_done from API values only,
  making the budget restart-proof and eliminating double-penalty on external calls.
- Fixed calculate_safety_reserve_interval to distribute over the full 3-hour safe
  window (was 1 hour, causing 3x too-frequent polling during the reset window).
- Fixed available_now to cap against effective_threshold instead of throttle_threshold.
- Fixed diagnostics user_so_far/user_excess: zone polls were incorrectly attributed
  as external user calls; now uses tracked poll counter.
- Fixed _update_learned_window: single_observation branch was unreachable dead code.
- Track actual polling calls in _polling_calls_today per fetch, reset on quota reset.

Coordinator & API:
- Improved error handling for transient API errors, falling back to last known
  good data to keep entities available.
- Fixed water heater target temperature hidden in AUTO mode for OpenTherm systems.
- Fixed away temperature never displaying or persisting correctly on startup.

Tado X:
- Infer INSIDE_TEMPERATURE_MEASUREMENT capability from device data when not

## [5.1.0](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v5.0.2...v5.1.0) (2026-03-13)

### ✨ New Features

* feat: extend bulk zone actions to AC zones, targeted manual_poll fetch, and water heater fix

feat(climate): extend bulk zone actions to include AC zones
resume_all, turn_off_all and boost_all previously only targeted HEATING
zones. AC zones (e.g. heat pumps) are now included in all bulk actions.
Zone type is resolved automatically per zone from metadata so the correct
overlay type is sent for both HEATING and AIR_CONDITIONING zones.
HOT_WATER zones remain excluded.

feat: targeted single-entity fetch for manual_poll
Extends manual_poll service with optional entity_id to allow targeted,
per-entity data refreshes instead of re-fetching all devices/zones:

- offsets: 1 API call for the specific device (vs. N devices)
- away_config: 1 API call for the specific zone (vs. N zones)
- capabilities: uses existing lazy cache, drops only that zone's entry
- bulk-only types (zone, metadata, presence, all): fall back to full refresh

DRY approach: _fetch_offsets/_fetch_away_config now delegate per-entry
work to _fetch_offset_for(serial) / _fetch_away_config_for(zone_id),
which are also the targeted fetch paths. EntityResolver gains
get_serial_from_entity() to resolve device entity → serial_no.

Usage:
  service: tado_hijack.manual_poll
  data:
    refresh_type: offsets
    entity_id: number.bedroom_temperature_offset   # optional

fix: add debug logging for bulk zone actions and fix water heater optimistic state

## [5.0.2](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v5.0.1...v5.0.2) (2026-03-05)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* fix(climate): AC and hot water climate entities always created regardless of full_cloud_mode

⚠️ UPGRADING FROM v4.x? READ THIS:
- Entity unique_ids changed → all entities will be recreated. Delete and
  re-add the integration to avoid duplicates.
- Minimum Home Assistant version is now 2024.11.0.
- Generation selection (Classic V2/V3 or Tado X) is now required on setup.
- Existing installs are migrated automatically on first load.
See v5.0.0 and v5.0.1 release notes for full details.

full_cloud_mode should only gate HEATING climate entities since those zones
are handled by HomeKit/Matter when disabled. AC zones have no HomeKit support
and their climate entities must always be created.

- V2/V3 AC climate entities: always created
- V2/V3 HEATING climate entities: only when full_cloud_mode=True
- Tado X climate entities: only when full_cloud_mode=True (Matter handles otherwise)
- Hot Water: unaffected, handled by water_heater platform

Users on v5.0.x missing AC climate entities: reload the integration,
no reinstall required.

## [5.0.1](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v5.0.0...v5.0.1) (2026-03-05)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* fix(config_flow): quota interval and safety reserve not persisted on save

Both values were extracted from the wrong section in _flatten_section_data,
causing them to silently reset to defaults on reopen. Also fixes a float
cast issue for safety reserve and updates mypy hook to python3.14.


### 📚 Documentation

* docs(core): upgrade notice for v5.0.0 breaking changes

For users upgrading from v4.x directly to v5.0.1: v5.0.0 introduced
breaking changes that require attention before upgrading.

⚠️ IMPORTANT — READ BEFORE UPGRADING FROM v4.x
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Entity unique_id format changed:
- Old: {entry_id}_{suffix}
- New: {entry_id}_zone_{zone_id}_{suffix}
- Effect: ALL entities will be recreated on first start after upgrade
- Action: Delete and re-add the integration to avoid duplicate entities

Minimum Home Assistant version: 2024.11.0 (required for Matter support)

New mandatory setup step:
- Generation selection is now required during initial config
- Choose "Tado V2/V3 (Classic API)" or "Tado X (Matter Bridge)"
- Existing installs will be migrated automatically on first load

See full v5.0.0 release notes for details on new features (Tado X support,
V2 bridge, full cloud mode, multi-account, redundancy suppression).

* docs(quota): document adaptive reset window learning (shipped in v5.0.0)

This feature was included in v5.0.0 but omitted from the release notes.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🧠 ADAPTIVE QUOTA RESET WINDOW LEARNING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Tado's daily API quota does not reset at a fixed time — the exact hour varies
per user account (observed: 7:30, 12:04, 14:xx, etc.). The integration now
learns your specific reset schedule automatically.

How it works (helpers/reset_window_tracker.py):
- Every detected quota reset is recorded with its timestamp
- Timestamps are normalized to X:30 to group resets within the same hour
- After 2 consecutive resets at the same hour → pattern is adopted ("learned")
- Single observation → stored but not adopted (may be anomaly)
- No pattern yet → fallback to default window (12:30)

Quota budget is then distributed relative to the learned reset time:
- Planning horizon: always minimum 20h ahead (conservative)
- Safety reserve: adaptively spread across the reset window
- Result: fewer wasted calls at end-of-day, smoother polling across 24h

Exposed via sensors (definitions.py):
- quota_reset_last: Last observed reset time
- quota_reset_next: Next expected reset time
- quota_reset_expected_window: Learned or default window
- quota_reset_pattern_confidence: "learned" / "single_observation" / "default"
- quota_reset_history_count: Number of resets in history (max 5)

State is persisted across HA restarts via helpers/storage.py.

## [5.0.0](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v4.3.0...v5.0.0) (2026-03-04)

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **core:** Multiple breaking changes for migration:
- Entity unique_ids now include config entry_id AND zone_id prefix for multi-account support (format: {entry_id}_zone_{zone_id}_{suffix}). Entities will be recreated on upgrade. Recommended: Delete and re-add the integration to avoid duplicates.
- Minimum Home Assistant version is now 2024.11.0 for Matter support.

This release introduces complete Tado X support with Matter integration, V2 bridge compatibility, optional full cloud mode for all generations, enhanced multi-account support, and a modular generation-based architecture.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

API Quota Optimization:
- New redundancy checker (helpers/redundancy_checker.py)
- CONF_SUPPRESS_REDUNDANT_CALLS: Skip API calls when target state matches cached state
- CONF_SUPPRESS_REDUNDANT_BUTTONS: Also skip button actions when all zones already match target
- Saves quota on accidental double-clicks, repeated UI interactions, or automation retries
- Only sends API calls when actual change detected

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚙️ AUTO QUOTA: MINIMUM INTERVAL CONFIGURATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Configurable Minimum Polling Interval:
- MIN_AUTO_QUOTA_INTERVAL_S reduced from 20 to 5 seconds (absolute floor)
- DEFAULT_MIN_AUTO_QUOTA_INTERVAL_S remains at 20 seconds (recommended default)
- Users can now set more aggressive polling if needed (e.g., for testing or high-quota V2 bridges)
- Default remains safe at 20s to protect against accidental account throttling
- Range: 5s-12h (configurable in Advanced Settings)

### ✨ New Features

* feat(core): Tado X support, V2/V3 generation, full cloud mode, multi-account, and comprehensive overhaul


### 📚 Documentation

* docs(readme): reformat table of contents and add support section

## [4.3.0](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v4.2.3...v4.3.0) (2026-02-23)

### ✨ New Features

* feat(entity): flexible entity_id configuration and zone sensor naming fix

**Zone Sensor Naming Fix:**
The naming logic for zone sensors was inconsistent (using 'home_id' instead of 'zone_name'). This commit aligns sensors with other zone entities (e.g., resulting in 'sensor.zone_name_humidity' instead of 'sensor.tado_home_name_zone_id_humidity').

**Note on Migration:**
Existing installations will likely retain the old 'sensor.tado_home_name_XX' IDs due to Home Assistant's Entity Registry persistence. To apply the new naming scheme, deleting and re-adding the integration is recommended.

**Entity ID Configuration:**
- Introduced '_entity_id_prefix' and '_entity_id_include_context' class attributes for fine-grained control.
- Bridge entities now use 'tado_ib' prefix and exclude serial numbers from entity_id.
- Simplified entity_id generation logic.

**Config Flow Improvements:**
- Consolidated multi-step config flow into single page.
- All settings now visible and editable in one view.

Affected entities: All zone-level sensors (humidity, heating_power, next_schedule_*, etc.)

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v1.1.0...v2.0.0) (2026-01-20)

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **core:** Complete architecture overhaul. Entities have been renamed and regrouped. Config flow and polling logic updated.

### ✨ New Features

* feat(core): architecture overhaul - smart batching, inheritance, homekit linking & controls

- Architecture: Migrated from monkey-patching to a clean inheritance model (TadoHijackClient).
- Device Mapping: Entities (Battery, Offset, Child Lock) are now mapped to physical devices (Valves) instead of Zones.
- HomeKit Linking: Automatically detects and links entities to existing HomeKit devices via Serial Number match.
- Smart Batching: Advanced TadoApiManager with CommandMerger logic merges multiple rapid commands into single Bulk API calls.
- Controls: Added Child Lock (Switch), Boost All Zones (Button), Turn Off All Zones (Button).
- Security: Implemented centralized, strict PII redaction (TadoRedactionFilter) for logs (strings & objects).
- Performance: Decoupled RateLimitManager, reduced default polling to 30m, and added configurable debounce (default 5s).
- Logic: Centralized OptimisticManager, TadoRequestHandler, AuthManager, and CommandMerger for robust and modular API handling.
- Documentation: Complete README overhaul with better structure and detailed API consumption table.

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v1.0.0...v1.1.0) (2026-01-17)

### ✨ New Features

* feat: add temperature offset sensors, throttled mode, and config improvements

FEATURES:
- Temperature offset sensor per device (1 API call per valve)
- Offset polling interval config (0 = disabled, only on manual poll)
- Throttled mode with configurable threshold
- API status sensor (connected/throttled/rate_limited)
- Manual poll and resume all schedules buttons with trailing debounce

FIXES:
- Options flow bug fixed (settings now persist correctly)
- Offset sensors now grouped under Zone device (like battery)
- Improved timeout message with API rate limit reset info (12:00 CET)

DOCS:
- Updated README with new features and per-valve API cost warning
- Clarified Matter is not supported (waiting for official HA Tado integration)
- Removed hardcoded rate limit references (varies month to month)

## 1.0.0 (2026-01-17)
